# TC-pump-probe
Data and codes for plotting to produce the Figures in the manuscript "Detection of anyon braiding through pump-probe spectroscopy" [(arXiv:2503.22792)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22792). Data for each figure are contained as `.jld2` files in the corresponding folder; the Jupyter notebook file includes all necessary Julia calculations to produce the plots in the paper from the raw data.
